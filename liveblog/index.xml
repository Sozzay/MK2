      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Um, can I ask you something Ibuki?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    BRING IT ON!   Did you play “Twilight Syndrome Murder Case”?   Wellllll... that&#39;s a computer game, right? I&#39;m basically awful at those things!   Ibuki’s a hardliner, so I don&#39;t touch anything powered by electricity except electric guitars!

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02     So this... was the real ending?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Yeah, that&#39;s the &#34;Truth Edition&#34;... The incident&#39;s 1st Day and 3rd Day are included in it.   Now you’ve seen the entirety of the game’s events, across all four days.   I see... It was a lot easier to understand this time.

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Okay... so I push “DOWN” five times, right?   Let’s give it a try...      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Twilight Syndrome Murder Case: Truth Edition   Ah! The screen changed!   Yeah, that’s the real game. Twilight Syndrome Murder Case’s “Truth Edition”.  At that moment, I felt my nerves return.  This game... it could reveal something about the murder.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   However, when we finally reached Jabberwock Park...  ...a certain someone was waiting for us.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Why hello there, Mahiru and Hajime. I&#39;m glad you guys are doing well.   Eh!? Nagito!?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It feels like... it&#39;s been a long time since I was able to talk to you two like this.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   There’s a sign stuck to this door... It seems to have some English written on it. No way I could read that...      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    You can’t take a shower! The shower’s under repair, so there’s no water coming out of the facets!   Ah, so this is a shower room?  If it’s out of order, that would explain the illustration on the sign.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   To begin with... I should look at the new Monokuma File.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   The victim is Chiaki Nanami. Estimated time of death is around 3:00 p.m..  The scene of the crime where the body was discovered is inside the beach house at Chandler Beach.  The cause of death is a single killing blow to the head with a blunt instrument.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   I couldn’t contain my scream.  What I saw in front of me... left me in complete shock.  Chiaki Nanamilying dead on the floor...   ...covered in blood.        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Chiaki Nanami...      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   She was really quiet, but... she definitely cared a lot about other people.  And that.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   When I entered the pharmacy, I immediately saw her cowering in the corner.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Hiyoko, are you alright?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    *Sniff*...   G... Go away. Leave me alone!   Wait, I can’t just-      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Stop it! Stop talking to me!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Mortal... you dare speak to me alone?   What? Should I be scared?    Huh?   If you think I’m intimidated by you, you need to grow up.   Growing up? My soul is decades old...   Then maybe you should act like it!       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Against my better judgment, I stayed by Gundham’s side as he continued to talk about bizarre and nonsensical things.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Oh, hi Mahiru.   I wasn’t able to ask at the meeting, but was Nagito alright?   Ah... Yeah, he was fine.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    So he was difficult, but not *too* difficult... at least for you.  Eh... did she just read my mind?   Speaking of the meeting, will you be coming to Sonia’s party?</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Not knowing what else to do, I joined Peko in her meditation session.

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   The sign over there says... “diner”.   I don’t know what that means, but judging by the outside of the building, I think this might be a restaurant.  I should probably look inside...        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Eh!?  Of course, the one person that had to be here...       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    .</description>

Then, is what Monomi said really...?  ...Nevermind that, what’s on the other side of this bridge?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   So this is the new island...?  It certainly... feels different from the first.  There might be clues that could help us escape this place, or at the very least understand it.</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    During the party, the killer...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    ...waslurking under the floor like a cockroach.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    They could&#39;ve stared at panties all day...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    ...without going to the storage room in the dark!      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Is that true, Fuyuhiko!</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Well, what now?       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    If the knife isn&#39;t the murder weapon, there&#39;s no definitive proof that I&#39;m the killer.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then what the hell was all that before...?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Y-You say you were shoved away, but...you can&#39;t actually prove it, right?</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Phew... It’s taken a long time to get here, hasn’t it?    Did you need a moment to clear your head?   You could put it that way.    Phuhu... It seems hunger makes you do crazy things, ‘cause that fruit nearly blindsided me!   Hueh?   Can you imagine? Abandoning this killing game... leaving its students to enjoy their holiday in peace.</description>

CASE&amp;nbsp;01    He has already confessed...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Um... You know...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    That bastard Nagito is the one who did it!</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Let’s cut to the chase... You’re correct! It was my doing all along!       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I’m the one who hid the knife under the table before the party started.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I’m the one who used the power cord to find my way to the table in the dark.</description>

CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I have an inkling, yeah... but I wanna know what you guys think.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then tell us. What is this damning clue?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I want to talk about how the killer got to the knife during the blackout.</description>

CASE&amp;nbsp;01    You&#39;re saying they went all the way to the storage room?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then that means everyone who was in the dining hall.</description>

So there&#39;s no way anybody else could&#39;ve locked themselves in the bathroom except Peko.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I-I guess that would be... true...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Y-You locked yourself in the commode?</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01   Be careful! The first kill will happen tonight. Someone will definitely kill someone.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Hey... The hell is this...?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Mahiru and I found this in Byakuya&#39;s cottage.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    It... appears to be a threat someone sent to Byakuya.

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I&#39;m sure Byakuya ducked under the table...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    ...during the blackout.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    That sounds correct!      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    If that&#39;s the case...       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    During the blackout, Mr. Ham Hands...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    .</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Now then, let&#39;s begin with a simple explanation of the class trial.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    During the class trial, you will present your arguments for who the killer is, and vote for &#34;whodunnit.&#34;   If you vote correctly, then only the blackened will receive punishment. But if you pick the wrong person...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I&#39;ll punish everyone *besides* the blackened, and that person will earn the right to leave this island!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    ...   Hmm, just as I thought.    It seems there&#39;s no way to get under the floor from inside this old building...maybe.  Yeah, just like Nagito said...  I guess that means Gundham will have to give up on his stupid earring.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Hajime, I trust you’ve been looking at those photos?</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    What? You’re here?   ...What’s your problem? Leave me alone.   ...  After everything that’s happened, I’d completely forgotten about our argument.  Hearing his voice again pissed me off... but for Byakuya’s sake, I had to be the bigger person.   Don’t give me that attitude right now. You must have heard Monokuma’s announcement, right?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Of course I did.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    The old building&#39;s circuit breaker should be inside this office.   They probably have something to do with the outage, right?   Right... so we should check it out first.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   So, those are the circuit breakers?  The power outage must have happened because they were tripped somehow...   Hmm, it doesn&#39;t look like someone did anything to it.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    It appears that only that wall is a different color and material... Why is that?   Oh, it&#39;s probably a fire door.   ...Fire door?   Eh? You’ve never seen one before?   It&#39;s a door that shuts to keep fire from spreading by containing it.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    M-My camera!?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Would you look at that? You must have placed it there and forgotten about it.   I-I&#39;d know better than to abandon my stuff at a busy party!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   My entire world had come grinding to a halt.  The scene in front of me was so intense... so overwhelming...  It bled over me, wrapped itself around me, and all I could do... was scream.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!   Byaku...ya...?   Wh-Why is Byakuya...?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   As the others rushed past me to look at the body, I remained firmly in place.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Teruteru, you’re searching the kitchen?   ...Yeah, of course.   Man, that blackout totally surprised me...   It doesn’t look like Byakuya is here. We should look elsewhere.</description>

How do you trip and land like *that*?   Yaaaay, an erotic pose! That&#39;s obviously a fanservice moment!   Eek... Nooooo... P-Please don&#39;t! Please don&#39;t look at me!   Eeeeeeee-hehehehe!

I did inform him about the party, but...Hey, you don’t need to apologize. It&#39;s his fault for not coming...  CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   I explicitly stated that attendance was mandatory, but...It&#39;s fine... If just one person is absent, that shouldn&#39;t pose a problem....He won&#39;t be able to do anything.</description>

There were goosebumps all over my body.  CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   I switch off the tablet and look up from where I’m sitting.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    What the heck is this...? Such a gigantic building.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    However, it is clearly faded... It looks like an ancient ruin.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It seems... Perhaps this is an actual ancient ruin?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    U...Um...Does anyone else agree it looks a little like.</description>

It certainly... feels different from the first.  There might be clues that could help us escape this place, or at the very least understand it.</description>

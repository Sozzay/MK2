      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Um, can I ask you something Ibuki?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    BRING IT ON!   Did you play “Twilight Syndrome Murder Case”?   Wellllll... that&#39;s a computer game, right? I&#39;m basically awful at those things!   Ibuki’s a hardliner, so I don&#39;t touch anything powered by electricity except electric guitars!

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02     So this... was the real ending?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Yeah, that&#39;s the &#34;Truth Edition&#34;... The incident&#39;s 1st Day and 3rd Day are included in it.   Now you’ve seen the entirety of the game’s events, across all four days.   I see... It was a lot easier to understand this time.

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Okay... so I push “DOWN” five times, right?   Let’s give it a try...      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Twilight Syndrome Murder Case: Truth Edition   Ah! The screen changed!   Yeah, that’s the real game. Twilight Syndrome Murder Case’s “Truth Edition”.  At that moment, I felt my nerves return.  This game... it could reveal something about the murder.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   However, when we finally reached Jabberwock Park...  ...a certain someone was waiting for us.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Why hello there, Mahiru and Hajime. I&#39;m glad you guys are doing well.   Eh!? Nagito!?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It feels like... it&#39;s been a long time since I was able to talk to you two like this.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   There’s a sign stuck to this door... It seems to have some English written on it. No way I could read that...      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    You can’t take a shower! The shower’s under repair, so there’s no water coming out of the facets!   Ah, so this is a shower room?  If it’s out of order, that would explain the illustration on the sign.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   To begin with... I should look at the new Monokuma File.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   The victim is Chiaki Nanami. Estimated time of death is around 3:00 p.m..  The scene of the crime where the body was discovered is inside the beach house at Chandler Beach.  The cause of death is a single killing blow to the head with a blunt instrument.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   I couldn’t contain my scream.  What I saw in front of me... left me in complete shock.  Chiaki Nanamilying dead on the floor...   ...covered in blood.        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Chiaki Nanami...      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   She was really quiet, but... she definitely cared a lot about other people.  And that.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   When I entered the pharmacy, I immediately saw her cowering in the corner.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Hiyoko, are you alright?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    *Sniff*...   G... Go away. Leave me alone!   Wait, I can’t just-      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Stop it! Stop talking to me!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Mortal... you dare speak to me alone?   What? Should I be scared?    Huh?   If you think I’m intimidated by you, you need to grow up.   Growing up? My soul is decades old...   Then maybe you should act like it!       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Against my better judgment, I stayed by Gundham’s side as he continued to talk about bizarre and nonsensical things.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Oh, hi Mahiru.   I wasn’t able to ask at the meeting, but was Nagito alright?   Ah... Yeah, he was fine.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    So he was difficult, but not *too* difficult... at least for you.  Eh... did she just read my mind?   Speaking of the meeting, will you be coming to Sonia’s party?</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Not knowing what else to do, I joined Peko in her meditation session.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   We didn’t share many words... but I feel we got a little bit closer.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   After getting some snacks from the restaurant, Hajime and I went to the courtyard and made ourselves comfortable by the pool.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It seems... Perhaps this is an actual ancient ruin?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    U...Um...Does anyone else agree it looks a little like.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   The sign over there says... “diner”.   I don’t know what that means, but judging by the outside of the building, I think this might be a restaurant.  I should probably look inside...        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Eh!?  Of course, the one person that had to be here...       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    .</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Ah, so it’s true!   The Monobeast that guarded this bridge is gone...  ...and the bridge’s gate is open!  Then, is what Monomi said really...?  ...Nevermind that, what’s on the other side of this bridge?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   So this is the new island...?  It certainly... feels different from the first.  There might be clues that could help us escape this place, or at the very least understand it.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Mortal... you dare speak to me alone?   What? Should I be scared?    Huh?   If you think I’m intimidated by you, you need to grow up.   Growing up? My soul is decades old...   Then maybe you should act like it!       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Against my better judgment, I stayed by Gundham’s side as he continued to talk about bizarre and nonsensical things.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Oh, hi Mahiru.   I wasn’t able to ask at the meeting, but was Nagito alright?   Ah... Yeah, he was fine.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    So he was difficult, but not *too* difficult... at least for you.  Eh... did she just read my mind?   Speaking of the meeting, will you be coming to Sonia’s party?</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Not knowing what else to do, I joined Peko in her meditation session.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   We didn’t share many words... but I feel we got a little bit closer.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   After getting some snacks from the restaurant, Hajime and I went to the courtyard and made ourselves comfortable by the pool.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    What the heck is this...? Such a gigantic building.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    However, it is clearly faded... It looks like an ancient ruin.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It seems... Perhaps this is an actual ancient ruin?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    U...Um...Does anyone else agree it looks a little like.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   The sign over there says... “diner”.   I don’t know what that means, but judging by the outside of the building, I think this might be a restaurant.  I should probably look inside...        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Eh!?  Of course, the one person that had to be here...       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    .</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Ah, so it’s true!   The Monobeast that guarded this bridge is gone...  ...and the bridge’s gate is open!  Then, is what Monomi said really...?  ...Nevermind that, what’s on the other side of this bridge?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   So this is the new island...?  It certainly... feels different from the first.  There might be clues that could help us escape this place, or at the very least understand it.</description>

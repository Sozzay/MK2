CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   After getting some snacks from the restaurant, Hajime and I went to the courtyard and made ourselves comfortable by the pool.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    What the heck is this...? Such a gigantic building.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    However, it is clearly faded... It looks like an ancient ruin.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It seems... Perhaps this is an actual ancient ruin?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    U...Um...Does anyone else agree it looks a little like.</description>

I should probably look inside...        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Eh!?  Of course, the one person that had to be here...       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    .</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Ah, so it’s true!   The Monobeast that guarded this bridge is gone...  ...and the bridge’s gate is open!  Then, is what Monomi said really...?  ...Nevermind that, what’s on the other side of this bridge?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   So this is the new island...?  It certainly... feels different from the first.  There might be clues that could help us escape this place, or at the very least understand it.</description>

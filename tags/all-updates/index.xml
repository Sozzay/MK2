      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    What the heck is this...? Such a gigantic building.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    However, it is clearly faded... It looks like an ancient ruin.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    It seems... Perhaps this is an actual ancient ruin?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    U...Um...Does anyone else agree it looks a little like.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   The sign over there says... “diner”.   I don’t know what that means, but judging by the outside of the building, I think this might be a restaurant.  I should probably look inside...        CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    Eh!?  Of course, the one person that had to be here...       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02    .</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   Ah, so it’s true!   The Monobeast that guarded this bridge is gone...  ...and the bridge’s gate is open!  Then, is what Monomi said really...?  ...Nevermind that, what’s on the other side of this bridge?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;02   So this is the new island...?  It certainly... feels different from the first.  There might be clues that could help us escape this place, or at the very least understand it.</description>

It was clear the events of yesterday were still heavy on everyone’s minds.  Byakuya was killed... and his killer was Teruteru...  And then Teruteru.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Geh-hehe... it looks like your argument has come to a close.   Oops! I lost control of my wild side for a second. Was that a side effect of the meat I just ate?   ...Well, putting that aside, let&#39;s move along to the nerve-wracking voting time! Please pull the lever in front of you and cast your vote.

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01   I don’t want to accuse anyone... Not again...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01   But... I have no choice.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01   The killer used the fire doors to block off the corridor, and moved through the darkness using my camera...       CASE&amp;nbsp;01   Then they snuck into the crawlspace, used the glow-in-the-dark paint as a landmark.</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    During the party, the killer...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    ...waslurking under the floor like a cockroach.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    They could&#39;ve stared at panties all day...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    ...without going to the storage room in the dark!

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Well, what now?       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    If the knife isn&#39;t the murder weapon, there&#39;s no definitive proof that I&#39;m the killer.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then what the hell was all that before...?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Y-You say you were shoved away, but...you can&#39;t actually prove it, right?</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Phew... It’s taken a long time to get here, hasn’t it?    Did you need a moment to clear your head?   You could put it that way.    Phuhu... It seems hunger makes you do crazy things, ‘cause that fruit nearly blindsided me!   Hueh?   Can you imagine? Abandoning this killing game... leaving its students to enjoy their holiday in peace.</description>

CASE&amp;nbsp;01    He has already confessed...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Um... You know...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    That bastard Nagito is the one who did it!</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Let’s cut to the chase... You’re correct! It was my doing all along!       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I’m the one who hid the knife under the table before the party started.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I’m the one who used the power cord to find my way to the table in the dark.</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    A clue, you say?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Do you know who the killer is?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I have an inkling, yeah... but I wanna know what you guys think.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then tell us. What is this damning clue?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I want to talk about how the killer got to the knife during the blackout.</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    If the irons in the storage room caused the blackout...       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then for the killer to turn the irons on...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    You&#39;re saying they went all the way to the storage room?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Then that means everyone who was in the dining hall.</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Everyone except Peko was in the hall after the party started, right?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I see... So there&#39;s no way anybody else could&#39;ve locked themselves in the bathroom except Peko.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I-I guess that would be... true...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Y-You locked yourself in the commode?</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01   Be careful! The first kill will happen tonight. Someone will definitely kill someone.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Hey... The hell is this...?      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Mahiru and I found this in Byakuya&#39;s cottage.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    It... appears to be a threat someone sent to Byakuya.

CASE&amp;nbsp;01    If that&#39;s the case...       CASE&amp;nbsp;01    During the blackout, Mr. Ham Hands...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    .</description>

      <description>CASE&amp;nbsp;01    Now then, let&#39;s begin with a simple explanation of the class trial.      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    During the class trial, you will present your arguments for who the killer is, and vote for &#34;whodunnit.&#34;   If you vote correctly, then only the blackened will receive punishment. But if you pick the wrong person...      CASE&amp;nbsp;01    I&#39;ll punish everyone *besides* the blackened, and that person will earn the right to leave this island!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    ...   Hmm, just as I thought.    It seems there&#39;s no way to get under the floor from inside this old building...maybe.  Yeah, just like Nagito said...  I guess that means Gundham will have to give up on his stupid earring.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Hajime, I trust you’ve been looking at those photos?</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    What? You’re here?   ...What’s your problem? Leave me alone.   ...  After everything that’s happened, I’d completely forgotten about our argument.  Hearing his voice again pissed me off... but for Byakuya’s sake, I had to be the bigger person.   Don’t give me that attitude right now. You must have heard Monokuma’s announcement, right?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Of course I did.</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    The old building&#39;s circuit breaker should be inside this office.   They probably have something to do with the outage, right?   Right... so we should check it out first.       CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   So, those are the circuit breakers?  The power outage must have happened because they were tripped somehow...   Hmm, it doesn&#39;t look like someone did anything to it.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    It appears that only that wall is a different color and material... Why is that?   Oh, it&#39;s probably a fire door.   ...Fire door?   Eh? You’ve never seen one before?   It&#39;s a door that shuts to keep fire from spreading by containing it.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    M-My camera!?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Would you look at that? You must have placed it there and forgotten about it.   I-I&#39;d know better than to abandon my stuff at a busy party!</description>

      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   My entire world had come grinding to a halt.  The scene in front of me was so intense... so overwhelming...  It bled over me, wrapped itself around me, and all I could do... was scream.      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!   Byaku...ya...?   Wh-Why is Byakuya...?      CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   As the others rushed past me to look at the body, I remained firmly in place.</description>

CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01    Teruteru, you’re searching the kitchen?   ...Yeah, of course.   Man, that blackout totally surprised me...   It doesn’t look like Byakuya is here. We should look elsewhere.</description>

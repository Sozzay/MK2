      <description>CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   ...Thank you for waiting.Teruteru is in the kitchen, and... it appears Fuyuhiko did not come.  CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   I apologize. I did inform him about the party, but...Hey, you don’t need to apologize. It&#39;s his fault for not coming...  CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   I explicitly stated that attendance was mandatory, but...It&#39;s fine... If just one person is absent, that shouldn&#39;t pose a problem....He won&#39;t be able to do anything.</description>

A MOST DESPAIR FILLED GAME  CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   This... this is unbelievable. Someone’s got to be pulling my leg here.Maybe it’s me. Maybe this is all one big demented dream.If it is, I’d do anything to wake up right now.As I triedto put my fragmented thoughts into words, something trickled down my spine.A familiar tingling sensation......Goosebumps. There were goosebumps all over my body.  CHAPTER&amp;nbsp;01   I switch off the tablet and look up from where I’m sitting.</description>
